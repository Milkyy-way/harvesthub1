-- HarvestHub — promo codes, farmer-scoped. Applied per-farm subsection at
-- checkout (see harvesthub-backend/app/checkout/), never across the whole
-- cart — a farmer's promo only ever discounts that one farmer's own
-- subtotal, since each farmer's items become a separate order.
--
-- Tax/delivery/service-fee rates are NOT in this schema — those are still
-- an undecided, cross-cutting business policy (jurisdiction tax rules,
-- mileage-based delivery pricing, platform commission), kept as constants
-- in harvesthub-backend/app/core/pricing.py so they're a one-file change
-- once decided, rather than a migration. Promo codes are different: they
-- genuinely vary per farmer today, so they need real rows.

-- Note: times_used is NOT incremented anywhere yet — there's no real order
-- creation to trigger redemption tracking from until that checkpoint ships.
-- Validation today checks usage_limit against whatever times_used already
-- holds, it just never advances it.

-- DEV/TEST SEED DATA (optional) — one sample code on two of 0010's seeded
-- farmers, so the checkout page's promo field has something real to try.
-- Safe no-op if those farmer rows don't exist.
